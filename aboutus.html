<p class="abc1">Sameer Seth (founder and CEO, Homies Kitchen) started his career as a banker, but soon realized it wasn’t his true love. When he thought about what made him truly happy, it was his food memories with his family. He started working at a friends’ restaurant in operations and then moved to Cornell University to pursue a masters from the School of Hotel Administration (SHA). That’s where he met Yash Bhanage (founder and COO, Homies Kitchen), who was an IHM Goa (India) graduate. Sameer and Yash hit it off from the word go. Although they were classmates for only eight months, they always kept in touch. After a couple of stints at various outlets and hotels, Sameer called Yash one fine day and asked, “How long are we going to keep doing this for someone else?” Even though at this point Yash was doing something interesting, subconsciously, he felt that he wasn’t getting any credit for it, really.<br>

It’s then that it all began. Sameer and Yash started discussing ideas and concepts over phone calls. In 2013, Sameer moved back to India and started scouting for locations. They found their dream location in March 2014. The Bombay Canteen opened doors to public on Feb. 11, 2015. It’s an all-day restaurant and bar that’s truly Indian at heart, that toasts the old and celebrates the new in unique and different ways through their food. What has made them the much-loved brand they are, and how did an emerging brand, founded by such young entrepreneurs (Yash is 33 and Sameer is 38), train their employees to take so much pride in their work? Here is their story.<br>

P.S. Sameer was traveling when we went in for this interview, so Yash stepped in to answer for the both of them.<br>

Vasundhara Sawhney: How did you come up with the concept of Homies Kitchen?<br>

Yash Bhanage: Through all our travels and places our work took us to, Sameer and I realized that people everywhere in the world were going back to their roots (when it came to food) and were trying to revive and make it better. In the U.S. Midwest, they were trying to make BBQs better, and in California, chefs were focusing more on ingredients that went into the food. Here in India, we were still stuck in an era of western food, and Sameer and I saw that as an opportunity. We realized that everyone’s idea of going out for an Indian meal was so clichéd. Even before you reached a restaurant, you knew what you were going to have: butter chicken and chicken tikka masala! The idea was to celebrate India as a whole (not north Indian food and south Indian food) and have a cultural and social context to the food.<br>
